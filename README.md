# Dev Enviornment

This is the configuration I use for setting up my dev machines. The main tools in my arsenal are:

* Vim
* terminator (linux)
* fish
* python

running `setup.sh` will setup the the entire dev enviornment. Tested on Ubuntu Desktop 20.04.

## Running

```
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

After running the setup script setup GPG and ssh.
