# Dev Enviornment

This is the configuration I use for setting up my dev machines. The main tools in my arsenal are:

* Vim
* terminator (linux) / iterm2 (osx)
* zsh
* python
* javascript

running `setup.sh` will setup the the entire dev enviornment. Tested on Ubuntu Server 18.04.

## Running

```
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```
